Project 3 is all about understanding architectural patterns as well as paying attention to implementing coding principles and design patterns to a web application.

# What is Web Application Development?

A `web application` is a client-server application program that is stored on a remote server and utilizes web technologies and browsers to carry out specified tasks via the Internet using a browser interface. Put simply, It is a computer software that utilizes a web browser to carry out some specific activities for its customer.

The process of creating an application that can be accessed through a web browser utilizing client-side and server-side programming is known as `web application development`, which is what this project is all about.

A web application is first conceptualized by developers in order to solve a particular problem, after which the app is designed, developed using the appropriate framework, tested, and then deployed. Below is an overview of the process of web development:

# Design Patterns in C#
`Design patterns` offer comprehensive solutions or a flexible approach to solving typical design issues. In the object-oriented world, design patterns are a reusable solution to typical software design issues that occur frequently in the creation of practical applications. It is a model or explanation of how to address issues that can be applied in a variety of circumstances.

# What is a Repository Design Pattern?
By definition, the `Repository Design Pattern` in C# acts as a bridge between the domain and data mapping layers by allowing access to the domain objects through a collection-like interface. Data access logic is divided and mapped to business logic components using the repository design pattern. It performs data access logic while interacting with the domain entities. In the Repository pattern, interfaces are used to communicate between domain entities, data access logic, and business logic. It shields the business logic from the specifics of data access.

# Step 1:
The first step is to `register` a user.

# Step 2:
After a user has been registered, they can then `log` into the application. Where they'll then be redirected to the home page of the application.

# Step 3:
Once a user has been `logged` into the application, they can then decide to `create` a Zone, Category, or Device. The application also has the fucntionality of viewing the `details` of a Device, Category, or Zone. They can `edit` the details of a either of these three or even `delete` them.

## An example of creating a Device:
Device home page:
